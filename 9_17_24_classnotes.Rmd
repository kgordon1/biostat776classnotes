```

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Entering Input
#At the R prompt we type expressions. The <- symbol is the assignment operator.
#object is "x" and value is 1
#print allows us to "see the object"
#Base R does not use quotes
```{r}
x <- 1
print(x)

```
```{r}
x
```
##X's value is 1
##x is a VECTOR and can have a lot of values
##When we print the object, R tells us what is in the vector

```{r}
msg <- "hello"
```

ERROR MESSAGES
##Grammar of the language determines whether an expression is complete or not.

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#| error: true
```{r}
x <-  ## Incomplete expression
```


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We were 
Error: <text>:2:0: unexpected end of input
1: x <-  ## Incomplete expression
   ^
The # character indicates a comment.

Anything to the right of the # (including the # itself) is ignored. This is the only comment character in R.

Unlike some other languages, R does not support multi-line comments or comment blocks.

Evaluation
When a complete expression is entered at the prompt, it is evaluated and the result of the evaluated expression is returned.

The result may be auto-printed.
```{r}
x <- 5  ## nothing printed
x       ## auto-printing occurs
print(x)  ## explicit printing
```
The [1] shown in the output indicates that x is a vector and 5 is its first element.

Typically with interactive work, we do not explicitly print objects with the print() function; it is much easier to just auto-print them by typing the name of the object and hitting return/enter.

However, when writing scripts, functions, or longer programs, there is sometimes a need to explicitly print objects because auto-printing does not work in those settings.

When an R vector is printed you will notice that an index for the vector is printed in square brackets [] on the side. For example, see this integer sequence of length 20.

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#| echo: false
old <- options(width = 40)


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```{r}
x <- 11:30
x
```
Number 23 is the 13th element of the vector
The numbers in the square brackets are not part of the vector itself, they are merely part of the printed output.



Note: You can control how an object is printed for others when you write the code
With R, it’s important that one understand that there is a difference between the actual R object and the manner in which that R object is printed to the console.

Often, the printed output may have additional bells and whistles to make the output more friendly to the users. However, these bells and whistles are not inherently part of the object.

```{r}
5:0
```
```{r}
-15:15
```
```{r}
x <- 11:30
```


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
R Objects
The most basic type of R object is a vector.

**Atomic vectors:**

logical: FALSE, TRUE, and NA
integer (and doubles): these are known collectively as numeric vectors (or real numbers)
complex: complex numbers
character: the most complex type of atomic vector, because each element of a character vector is a string, and a string can contain an arbitrary amount of data

**Lists:** which are sometimes called recursive vectors because lists can contain other lists.

**There’s one other related object: NULL.**

NULL is often used to represent the absence of a vector (as opposed to NA which is used to represent the absence of a value in a vector).
NULL typically behaves like a vector of length 0.

Create an empty vector
Empty vectors can be created with the vector() function.

Create a voctor with 4 items but not specifying any values yet
```{r}
vector(mode = "numeric", length = 4)
```
```{r}
vector(mode = "logical", length = 4)
```
```{r}
vector(mode = "character", length = 4)
```
Creating a non-empty vector
The c() function can be used to create vectors of objects by concatenating things together.

```{r}
x <- c(0.5, 0.6)       ## numeric
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)    ## logical
x <- c(T, F)           ## logical
x <- c("a", "b", "c")  ## character  we know it is a character because it is in ""
x <- 9:29              ## integer
x <- c(1+0i, 2+4i)     ## complex   
```


**Note
In the above example, T and F are short-hand ways to specify TRUE and FALSE.**

However, in general, one should try to use the explicit TRUE and FALSE values when indicating logical values.

The T and F values are primarily there for when you’re feeling lazy.


**Lists**
So, I know I said there is one rule about vectors:

**A vector can only contain objects of the same class**

But of course, like any good rule, there is an exception, which is a list (which we will get to in greater details a bit later).

For now, just know a list is represented as a vector but can contain objects of different classes. Indeed, that’s usually why we use them.

The main difference between atomic vectors and lists is that atomic vectors are homogeneous, while lists can be heterogeneous.

```{r}
leo_list <- list(1.5, "leo")
leo_list
```
```{r}
leo_list2 <- c(1.5, "leo")
leo_list2
```
This saves both as a character.

**Numerics**
Integer and double vectors are known collectively as numeric vectors.

In R, numbers are doubles by default.

To make an integer, place an L after the number:

```{r}
typeof(4)
```
```{r}
typeof(4L)
```
Let’s explore this. What is square of the square root of two? i.e. 
```{r}
x <- sqrt(2) ^ 2
x
```
2 in this case is not an integer, it is a double

Try subtracting 2 from x? What happened?
the square root of 2 is an approximation in R, it will never be a whole number, so the answer will provide an integer that is larger than expected
Any number with decimals i going to be an approximation
R calculates things one step at a time

```{r}
x - 2
```
**Numbers**
Numbers in R are generally treated as numeric objects (i.e. double precision real numbers).

This means that even if you see a number like “1” or “2” in R, which you might think of as integers, they are likely represented behind the scenes as numeric objects (so something like “1.00” or “2.00”).

This isn’t important most of the time…except when it is!

If you explicitly want an integer, you need to specify the L suffix. So entering 1 in R gives you a numeric object; entering 1L explicitly gives you an integer object.

There is also a special number Inf which represents infinity. This allows us to represent entities like 1 / 0. This way, Inf can be used in ordinary calculations; e.g. 1 / Inf is 0.

The value NaN represents an undefined value (“not a number”); e.g. 0 / 0; NaN can also be thought of as a missing value (more on that later)




#| echo: false
options(old)

Attributes
R objects can have attributes, which are like metadata for the object.

These metadata can be very useful in that they help to describe the object.

For example, column names on a data frame help to tell us what data are contained in each of the columns. Some examples of R object attributes are

names, dimnames
dimensions (e.g. matrices, arrays)
class (e.g. integer, numeric)
length
other user-defined attributes/metadata
Attributes of an object (if any) can be accessed using the attributes() function. Not all R objects contain attributes, in which case the attributes() function returns NULL.

However, every vector has two key properties:

Its type, which you can determine with typeof().
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```{r}
letters
```
```{r}
typeof(letters)
```
```{r}
1:10
```
```{r}
x <- list("a", "b", 1:10)
x
```
[[1]] is an element of the list

```{r}
l <- list(1:20, list("leo", 5:15, letters))
l
```
The list above has 2 elements but one of the elements has 3 parts

```{r}
length(x)
```
Length tells us how many elements in the vector.

```{r}
typeof(x)
attributes(x)
```


Let’s use typeof() to ask what happens when we mix different classes of R objects together.
**There is automatic coersion**

```{r}
y <- c(1.7, "a")
y <- c(TRUE, 2)
y <- c("a", TRUE)
```

y<- c(1.7, "a") R defaults the 1.7 to a character

y <c(TRUE, 2)  defaults as a double

y<- c("a", TRUE) defaults to character

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```{r}
typeof(y)
```
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
x <- 0:6
typeof(x)
as.logical(x)
typeof(as.logical(x))
```
**Matrices**
Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute.

The dimension attribute is itself an integer vector of length 2 (number of rows, number of columns)


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 3) 
m
```

Dimension
Rows, columns


```{r}
dim(m)
```
first dimension is rows = 2
second dimension is columns = 3

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matrices are constructed column-wise, so entries can be thought of starting in the “upper left” corner and running down the columns

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3) 
m
```




## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## try it here 



## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matrices can also be created directly from vectors by adding a dimension attribute.
```{r}
m <- 1:10 
m
dim(m) <- c(2, 5)
m
```

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matrices can be created by column-binding or row-binding with the cbind() and rbind() functions.
e.g. 

Adding columns with cbind
```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- 10:12
cbind(x, y)
```
```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- 10:12
rbind(x, y)
```
Above is an rbind() to row bind x and y above.




## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lists
Lists are a special type of vector that can contain elements of different classes. Lists are a very important data type in R and you should get to know them well.

Pro-tip
Lists, in combination with the various “apply” functions discussed later, make for a powerful combination.

Lists can be explicitly created using the list() function, which takes an arbitrary number of arguments.

```{r}
x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1 + 4i) 
x
```
We can also create an empty list of a prespecified length with the vector() function
```{r}
x <- vector("list", length = 5)
x
```


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factors
Factors are used to represent categorical data and can be unordered or ordered. One can think of a factor as an integer vector where each integer has a label.

Pro-tip
Factors are important in statistical modeling and are treated specially by modelling functions like lm() and glm().

Using factors with labels is better than using integers because factors are self-describing.

Pro-tip
Having a variable that has values “Yes” and “No” or “Smoker” and “Non-Smoker” is better than a variable that has values 1 and 2.

Factor objects can be created with the factor() function.

```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no")) 
x
table(x) 
```
Adds a summary called LEVELS

table(x) is the number of characters

## See the underlying representation of factor
to look at the structure behind the factor x
```{r}
unclass(x) 
```
values for "yes" is the number 2

Base level is always 1 instead of zero
 


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often factors will be automatically created for you when you read in a dataset using a function like read.table().

Those functions often default to creating factors when they encounter data that look like characters or strings.
The order of the levels of a factor can be set using the levels argument to factor(). This can be important in linear modeling because the first level is used as the baseline level.
## try it here 

```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
x  ## Levels are put in alphabetical order
```

```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"),
            levels = c("yes", "no"))
x
```


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Missing Values**
Missing values are denoted by NA or NaN for undefined mathematical operations.

is.na() is used to test objects if they are NA

is.nan() is used to test for NaN

NA values have a class also, so there are integer NA, character NA, etc.

A NaN value is also NA but the converse is not true

```{r}
## Create a vector with NAs in it
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 10, 3)  
## Return a logical vector indicating which elements are NA
is.na(x)    
```


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Now create a vector with both NA and NaN values
x <- c(1, 2, NaN, NA, 4)
is.na(x)
is.nan(x)


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x <- data.frame(foo = 1:4, bar = c(T, T, F, F)) 
x
nrow(x)
ncol(x)
attributes(x)


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data.matrix(x)
attributes(data.matrix(x))

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
